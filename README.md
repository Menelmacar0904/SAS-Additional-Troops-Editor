# SAS-Additional-Troops-Editor
  Serve as Soldier is a GREAT mod for Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, but it has one small problem when working with other mods that add new troops: it cannot recognize more than two troops up a branch. That is to say, if you've got four types of troops as direct upgrade of a recruit, SAS would only acknowledge the first two.
In fact, the original author addressed this issue by creating the Additional_Troops.xml file, which allows for the addition of new troops. However, this addition only contains troops for Eagle Rising (which is another great mod). This project is a tool that can add all those mod troops into the Additional_Troops.xml file, provided your have the path of the mod troops file.
  If this project has violated your copyright and etc. in any way, let me know and I'll modify or delete it.
