# SAS-Additional-Troops-Editor
Serve as Soldier is a GREAT mod for Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, but it has one small problem when working with other mods that add new troops: it cannot recognize more than two troops up a branch. That is to say, if you've got four types of troops as direct upgrade of a recruit, SAS would only acknowledge the first two. This project solves it.
